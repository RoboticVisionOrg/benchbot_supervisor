# BenchBot Supervisor

The BenchBot Supervisor is a HTTP server facilitating communication between the user facing code of the [BenchBot API](https://github.com/RoboticVisionOrg/benchbot_api) and the low-level ROS components in the [BenchBot Simulator](https://github.com/RoboticVisionOrg/benchbot_simulator) (or on *real robots*!).

Proper documentation may come later (read: "here be dragons").
